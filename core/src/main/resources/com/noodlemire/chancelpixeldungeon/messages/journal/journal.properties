journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title=Introduction
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body=Greetings Adventurer!\n\nYou are reading the amazing Adventurer's Guide to Dungeoneering! This guidebook is full of tips and tricks to help budding adventurers survive and excel!\n\nWhile you can read this guide all at once, it is best used as a reference. Make sure to check it whenever you're struggling.\n\nKeep your wits about you, and remember:\nDON'T PANIC!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title=Identifying Items
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body=Identifying items can be just as important as finding them!\n\nThe colors on potions and glyphs on scrolls are different in each dungeon, so you won't know what effect you'll get if they're unidentified.\n\nUnidentified equipment can be upgraded if you're lucky, or it might be cursed! Accidentally equipping a cursed item is bad, but usually isn't instant doom.\n\nScrolls of identify, upgrade, or remove curse are very useful if you want to reduce the risk of unidentified items.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the items tab of your journal)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining_and_searching.title=Examining and Searching
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining_and_searching.body=Charging forward recklessly is a great way to get killed.\n\nThere's always time to slow down and examine things around you, which can help you figure out the best way to approach a situation. Rushing into enemies is almost never the best way to deal with them.\n\nDungeons are full of secret passages and traps which appear invisible at first glance. It's good to be willing to thoroughly search an area if you suspect something is hidden.\n\n(The magnifying glass button is used for examining and searching. Tap it once and then tap on something to examine, tap it twice to search the area around you)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Strength and Upgrades
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=There won't be any time to train with weapons and armor you find in the dungeon, so you'll need brute strength to use them effectively.\n\nGaining combat experience can gradually enhance your physical might and is the most effective way to meet the requirements of higher tier gear. \n\nScrolls of Upgrade are primarily for making equipment stronger, but also reduce weight. However each upgrade will be less effective at reducing weight than the last.\n\nIt's important to work towards heavier, high tier items, but don't completely ignore equipment you can use sooner as well.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Dealing with Hunger
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=Using food effectively is one of the best things you can do to improve your odds of survival.\n\nHunger ultimately affects your health: you will slowly heal when satiated and slowly lose health when starving. Losing health may sound bad, but as long as you don't die, losing health has no direct penalty.\n\nIt's best to think of health and hunger as resources that need to be managed, not kept full at all times. For example, if you have full health, the health regen you get from being full will be wasted.\n\nBe careful about pacing out your hunger too much, however. Starvation will only continue to worsen the more you ignore it, so always keep a watchful eye on your well being.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dynamic.title=Dynamic Strength
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dynamic.body=Also known as your combat stamina, dynamic strength is a measure of your readiness to strike at full power.\n\nAt a basic level, dynamic strength lowers when you directly attack enemies and rises when you do anything else. In turn, it affects how much damage you will do. Maximum dynamic strength means maximum damage, and the same applies to minimum dynamic strength/damage.\n\nYou can imagine this feeling as a glow in your fist, which ranges in color from red at max, to yellow, to nonexistent if you're completely drained.\n\nThe most important thing to know is that you don't strictly need to rest in order to replenish this. If you're low, using consumables will be just as effective as standing still. Moving will not replenish it at all.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Gaining Experience
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=As you defeat enemies your level of experience will increase. Your experience determines how accurate your attacks are, how easily you can dodge, how much health you have, how adept you are at wielding heavy weapons, and you long you can repeatedly attack before needing to rest.\n\nYour experience level makes a big difference in combat. Typically, it's best to have at least one level for each floor of the dungeon.\n\nIt can be tempting to rush through a dungeon, avoiding exploration and combat, but doing so will deprive you of everything you need to continue surviving.\n\n(You can see information about your hero, including exp, on the status pane at the top of the game interface. Tap on your hero portrait to get even more info)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title=Surprise Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body=One of the best ways to get the upper hand in combat is with surprise attacks.\n\nA surprise attack occurs whenever you attack an enemy while you are out of their sight, or right as you come into view. Even the most evasive of enemies can't dodge a surprise attack!\n\nOne of the most common parts of the environment you can use to surprise enemies is a door. An enemy will be open to a surprise attack right as they move through a closed door.\n\n(When you successfully land a surprise attack, a yellow exclamation mark will briefly appear ontop of the enemy you just struck)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title=Handling Defeat
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body=If a situation is looking grim, there's no shame in running away. Escaping to another part of the dungeon can give you some time to recover before trying again.\n\nUnfortunately, dungeoneering is a very dangerous profession and most adventurers will eventually meet their demise. While luck can definitely play a role, the best adventurers are the ones who use every little trick to improve their odds.\n\n(Don't be dissuaded if you are dying a lot. You shouldn't expect to get very far in your first few tries, this game is hard! Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, don't focus on winning right away.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.title=Effective Looting
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.body=Specific rooms will often contain better loot than others. Some of these rooms will be behind locked doors, or will contain obstacles which must be navigated past.\n\nWhenever an obstacle like this blocks your progress, look for a solution nearby. Whether it's a key or something more crafty, there is usually a tool you can use on the same floor.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are an excellent measure of how well you're exploring and looting. You will be able to find 3 scrolls of upgrade and 2 potions of strength per dungeon region.\n\n(You can see a list of important landmarks and unused keys in the notes tab of the journal window.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title=Magical Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body=Magical attacks cut right through armor and are extremely difficult to dodge.\n\nThis means that damage you deal with wands will be very reliable, but also makes magical enemies extremely dangerous.\n\nMagical attacks always have a caveat though. In the case of wands it's their limited charges, wands become almost useless if they aren't given time to recharge. Magic that enemies use will always have some form of weakness as well. \n\nWhen facing enemies that use magic it is extremely important to figure out how to evade their magic, rather than just eating the damage from it.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.targets.title=Choosing Your Damage
journal.document.adventurers_guide.targets.body=Under the previously explained principle of Dynamic Strength, you must wait or use consumables to ensure that your next strike deals maximum damage. However, this isn't something you need to do all of the time.\n\nBeing able to predict the damage of your next attack can be very powerful. When an enemy is one attack away from death, you can figure out the optimal amount of turns to wait so you are guaranteed to beat it without taking more damage than necessary. Or, if you find yourself with an excessively strong attack ready, you can divert it to a healthier foe first before finishing off the injured one.\n\nTry experimenting with your weapon's capabilities in single combat. Once you gain a feel for what "low", "medium", and "high" damage currently means, you'll be able to handle many situations with relative ease.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.consumables.title=Using Consumables
journal.document.adventurers_guide.consumables.body=There are many traps, monsters, and other dangers waiting within the dungeon. You will likely find yourself in a variety of sticky situations, which you can't simply fight your way out of.\n\nYou might think that this is the best time to use consumables. However, this is only the time to use your strongest items, which can get you out of many situations unless you run out too quickly.\n\nWhen you see a strong group of monsters, look around and plan ahead. Try to find uses for your weaker consumables first, in case you can avoid having to use better ones. Don't hesitate to run out of a certain kind of item if you only have one use for it, because many scenarios are unlikely to repeat themselves.

journal.document.idiots_guide.title=Adventurer's Guide MXXI
journal.document.idiots_guide.intro.title=Go Die in a Hole Already
journal.document.idiots_guide.intro.body=Yo, numbskull. Are you really going to read this crap? I can guarantee you the first. Not even the idiots who forced me to write this would actually bother to read it themselves, because duh. It's useless, all basic garbage that everyone knows. But whatever, I guess I'll put it down anyways.\n\nThis is the Adventurer's Guide to Dungeoneering MXXI. If the title were up to me, I'd call it "Dungeons for Dumbasses 101", but sadly I have to use the official name.\n\nOn the off chance someone actually tries reading this, I'll pity them. A lot. That being said, the obvious basics are to never panic and to try and think every situation through. You can check any relevant sections whenever you want, or if you're a nerd you could read it all at once, I don't care. Do you care, dear reader? You'll probably just die in a hole anyways.
journal.document.idiots_guide.identifying.title=Curiosity Kills the Adventurer
journal.document.idiots_guide.identifying.body=What, you don't know anything? You're reading this, of course you don't, what am I saying?\n\nThis dungeon is super cursed, potions and scrolls change what they do on a regular basis. You're on your own to figure out what they do.\n\nWhat, do some morons not know this? Okay, so cursed equipment is bad for you, duh. Well, it's not so bad that you would be screwed, but don't go around trying on every little thing like a dummy.\n\nScrolls of identify are your holy savior to tell you everything about your items that I can't tell you. And for curses, use scrolls of upgrade or cleansing, either can work. Or you can just use stuff all willy-nilly to find out what it does, I'm sure that works too. Just ask those dead guys over in the next room.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the items tab of your journal)
journal.document.idiots_guide.dynamic.title=No, You Aren't Supposed to Tickle Foes to Death
journal.document.idiots_guide.dynamic.body=Are you getting confused that your expected rampage ended in you barely able to poke the enemies? It's probably too late for your brainless self, so please be polite and keep your blood off this book so the next guy can read it. Thanks.\n\nKnow that that damage you deal is dependent on your combat stamina, sometimes called "dynamic strength" by edgy kids.\n\nYour combat stamina determines how much damage you deal. Max stamina means max damage, and vice versa for min. As you attack, you will lose stamina. If you don't attack or move, you will replenish it. That's not too complicated for you, is it? You'd better hope not.\n\nCan't handle letting enemies bet you up? Get some real armor. Or use some of those items you find laying around everywhere.\n\nYou can imagine this feeling as a glow in your fist, which ranges in color from red at max, to yellow, to nonexistent if you're completely drained.
journal.document.idiots_guide.examining_and_searching.title=Stumbling Blindly and Dying
journal.document.idiots_guide.examining_and_searching.body=Okay, so here's a shocker. You have eyes, eyes that can see things. I know, big surprise. But, but, here's the real kicker: They don't always let you see every little secret. It's only the same tactic criminals have been using for that past, I dunno, 1000 years? Truly bleeding edge technology here.\n\nYou'll probably find hidden pressure plates and secret doors everywhere. Just brush off the illusion dust with your hands, it's not hard. Of course, be gentle when you do it. Don't be that dimwit who killed himself by slamming his hand on a trap to "search" for it.\n\n(The magnifying glass button is used for examining and searching. Tap it once and then tap on something to examine something to see its description, tap it twice to search the area around you to discover secrets)
journal.document.idiots_guide.strength.title=Breaking Your Back to Wield Your Weapon
journal.document.idiots_guide.strength.body=Okay, imagine this gigantic sword as tall as you are. Do you think you can hold that? No you can't. That's not a challenge, that's common sense you nincompoop.\n\nYou can increase your strength by killing monsters and stuff. Not immediately, but once you gain enough experience, you'll know what to do to make your muscles stronger.\n\nScrolls of upgrade can be used to reduce an object's weight, so even the weaklings out there will have a suitable option. But seriously, just train, it's way more effective. Trust me.\n\nIn the meantime, don't ignore weaker gear that you can use now. I can bet you that any super-weapon you have is only in your hands because someone didn't follow my expert advice. Don't be that guy.
journal.document.idiots_guide.food.title=Starving Like a True Glutton
journal.document.idiots_guide.food.body=Yeah, you fatty, I am talking to you. You eat too much. You don't enjoy starving? Too bad for you, you'll need to ration food by starving yourself for short periods of time or you'll run out of food. At the same time, don't lead yourself to a skinny man's grave. Or do, your starved belly will probably amuse some monster when they find your uneaten food.\n\nStarvation will keep getting worse if you wait too long before eating. No amount of healing can replace the need to eat forever, so don't even try.\n\nAlso, if you're injured and not starving, you can slowly heal from any wound. You don't need to freak out over every loss of health. Some would consider walking around completely healthy and full to be a waste of your body's natural healing.
journal.document.idiots_guide.levelling.title=Training, Like You Should Have Done Already
journal.document.idiots_guide.levelling.body=What, you're only now ready to gain experience? You picked a poor time, but that's probably the least of your poor life decisions if you're still here.\n\nAs you kill things, you gain experience, and with enough experience, you get stronger. You'll be more accurate and evasive, and your combat stamina will increase a little, too. Obviously.\n\nWhen you get stronger, you can focus on training one of three specific traits: your health, your muscles, or your capacity to handle magical objects without just exploding in a burst of raw power.\n\nThere are lots of bad habits for harebrained fools to consider. Focusing only on using equipment so anything can slay your and your poor health instantly. Exclusively gaining health as if that's all you need to survive. Rushing through the dungeon in general, eager to get your underpowered butt kicked at the first opportunity.\n\nJust kill whatever you find and balance how you train yourself. It's not hard if you're not careless.
